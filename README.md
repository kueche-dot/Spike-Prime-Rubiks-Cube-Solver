## 📖 What is it?

The **Spike-Prime-Rubiks-Cube-Solver** is a project aimed at developing a Rubik’s Cube solving robot using LEGO Spike Prime. The goal is to automate the solving process by leveraging Spike Prime’s motors, sensors, and programming capabilities.

🔹 **Current Status:** The project is **not yet finished**. While we have made significant progress, there are still challenges to overcome before achieving a fully functional solution.  

🔹 **Why share it?**  
Even though it’s incomplete, we want to document our journey, share our thoughts, and provide insights into our approach. By doing so, we hope to inspire others, receive feedback, and contribute to the community of robotics and puzzle-solving enthusiasts.
