## 📖 What is it?

The **Spike-Prime-Rubiks-Cube-Solver** is a project aimed at developing a Rubik’s Cube solving robot using LEGO Spike Prime. The goal is to automate the solving process by leveraging Spike Prime’s motors, sensors, and programming capabilities.

🔹 **Current Status:** The project is **not yet finished**. While we have made significant progress, there are still challenges to overcome before achieving a fully functional solution.  

🔹 **Why share it?**  
Even though it’s incomplete, we want to document our journey, share our thoughts, and provide insights into our approach. By doing so, we hope to inspire others, receive feedback, and contribute to the community of robotics and puzzle-solving enthusiasts.

🚀 Getting Started
This section will help you set up and run the Spike-Prime-Rubiks-Cube-Solver.

1️⃣ Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

🔹 Hardware Requirements:

✅ LEGO Spike Prime Kit (with motors & sensors)
✅ Rubik's Cube (5.5 cm on each side)
✅ A computer with LEGO Spike App installed
✅ USB cable or Bluetooth connection
🔹 Cube Specifications:

The robot is designed for a 5.5 cm (55 mm) Rubik’s Cube
The cube uses colors that the LEGO Spike Prime color sensor can recognize (typically white, yellow, red, blue, green, and orange)

🔹 Software Requirements:

✅ LEGO Spike Prime Software

2️⃣ Installation Instructions
